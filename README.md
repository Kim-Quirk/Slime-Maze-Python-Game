# Overview
This is Slime Maze! It's a simple maze game. Your goal is to escape the maze by touching the exit door. Collect coins to earn points. Escaping the maze also earns more points. Avoid enemy worms. The worms will kill you and make you have to start over! There's different levels and pressing R will bring you back to the level selector.

I wrote this program to become more familiar with game design and Python Arcade. I have not done much with the arcade library and learning how to make a game in Python was a lot of fun.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

Tool(s): Visual Studio Code

Language(s): Python

Libraries: Arcade and Pandas

# Future Work

* Change the restart button to restart your current level.
* Add three buttons to the "You Lose" screen. One button restarts the current level, another brings you to level selector, and the third exits or quits the game.
* Adjust enemies to explore the whole maze and not just left to right.
